How to Install and Run the Project
# Step 1. Create a New Repo in GitHub
Open your browser and log in to your GitHub account.
Select 'Create New Repository' from the dropdown menu, and name your repo.
Select the Public option so others can view your repository, and add a README.md file.
Click the 'Create repository' button to finalize the process.
Clone your repo to local using your new URL pasted into the following example command.
git clone https://github.com/youraccount/yourrepo
Create your .gitignore and requirements.txt files.
Run the following command from your project route directory to create your virtual environment.
py -m venv .venv
Use the following commands to add files to version control. IMPORTANT: Replace the commit message with a clear and descriptive note about what you added or changed.
git add . # stages changes, adds files to source control
git commit -m "Add .gitignore and requirements.txt files" # creates a labeled snapshot of staged changes.
git push -u origin main # updates the remote repository
Open the newly cloned folder to begin working in it by selecting 'file' 'open folder' navigate to the new repo and select 'open'.
# Step 2. Activate Your .venv
Before making any changes to a project, ALWAYS pull the latest changes from the remote repository on GitHub using the following command.
git pull origin main
Run the following command to activate your .venv # HINT- You MUST activate your .venv before editing a project.
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Step 3. Install Packages Into Your Local Project Virtual Environment
Ensure your .venv is active, update key packages, and install dependencies from your requirements.txt using the following commands.
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Repeatable Project Workflow
Follow these steps when starting a new work session on a professional Python project.

# 1. Pull the Latest Changes from GitHub:
git pull origin main
# 2. Activate the Project Virtual Environment:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# 3. Install Dependencies As Needed:
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# 4. Run Scripts as needed:
py myfile.py
# 5. Run Jupyter Notebooks as needed:
click the kernel selector in the top-right corner of the notebook editor and choose the interpreter associated with your .venv.
Click on a cell and press Shift+Enter to execute it and move to the next cell.
Alternatively, use Ctrl+Enter to execute the current cell without moving.
Use 'Run ALL' to execute notebooks fully before running git add-commit-push to GitHub.
Save your notebook periodically to avoid losing progress. Or make sure the File / Autosave option is on.
# 6. Save your work with git add-commit-push to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Add your unique message here."
git push -u origin main
